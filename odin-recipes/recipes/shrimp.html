        <p>For this chimichurri shrimp, I made the chimichurri sauce from scratch for the first time, and boy am I glad I did. I used fresh oregano instead of dried, and I love how it turned out and think you will too. This zesty herb-based sauce is packed with flavor. Serve with crusty bread to soak up the delicious blend of herbs and olive oil.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
